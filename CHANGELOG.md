# Changelog

## 1.6.0

### Added
- **Proactive clarification & planning prompts.** The agent now uses the `AskUserQuestion` multiple-choice popup before significant or ambiguous work and at key planning decisions. Options are navigated with arrow keys and submitted; the last "Other" entry always lets you type a custom answer.
- **Smarter prompt handling.** New always-on guidance makes the agent resolve ambiguity before acting, work in verifiable steps and check each step's output against the request before continuing, verify work actually runs before reporting done, report outcomes faithfully, and keep changes precisely scoped and professional.

### Changed
- **Fewer permission prompts (Balanced default).** When no permission mode is explicitly configured, sessions now start in `acceptEdits`: in-project file edits and safe filesystem/read-only commands are auto-approved, while risky or out-of-project actions still prompt. Override anytime with `permissions.defaultMode` or `--permission-mode`.
- **Elegant breathing spinner.** The house glyph (`⌂`) and bar now pulse smoothly between dim and bright instead of hard-blinking.
